# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is a project I worked on via [Codédex](https://codedex.io/) (specifically the [Python](https://codedex.io/python) course).

The rules are simple:
> Scissors cuts Paper,
Paper covers Rock,
Rock crushes Lizard,
Lizard poisons Spock,
Spock smashes Scissors,
Scissors decapitates Lizard,
Lizard eats Paper,
Paper disproves Spock,
Spock vaporizes Rock,
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.

I'm also using this project to complete the [Codédex](https://codedex.io/) [Git & Github](https://codedex.io/git-github/) course.
